- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheonlyqueenAC (she/her, X), a Queer, radical Witch and Infectious Diseases physician who has spent 15 years studying nearly every aspect of HIV and currently works in NYC and SF as a medical scientist and part of a research team engaged in a series of international RCTs to evaluate a novel, first in class ARV agent for HIV PrEP.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use data science and machine learning to help improve diversity in clinical trials and to create algorithms for AI to interact in nonjudgmental ways where humans have struggled for decades and created devistating stigma.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...the basics.  MicroMasters MITx program
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, after learning about the specific ways Galit Alter and Regina Barzilay are utilizing ML to improve antibody development at CROI this year...anything they could possibly guide me on...
- 📫 How to reach me ... demiac203@pm.me
